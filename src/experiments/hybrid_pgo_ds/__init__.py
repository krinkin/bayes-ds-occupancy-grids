# H-003 Experiment: Hybrid PGO + Cell Fusion Comparison
#
# Three-arm comparison of occupancy grid cell fusion methods:
# 1. Bayesian log-odds
# 2. Bayesian log-odds + observation count
# 3. Dempster-Shafer / Transferable Belief Model (DS/TBM)
#
# All arms share identical PGO alignment. Only cell fusion differs.
# See docs/debates/hybrid-pgo-ds-verdict.md for full experiment specification.
